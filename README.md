Simple Chrome Dinosaur Game
This is a simple arcade game inspired by the classic Chrome dinosaur game. Instead of the default dinosaur character and desert background, I've used a different character and background to give it a unique look and feel.

Features

Under Development: The game is still under development, with plans to add new features and improve existing ones for a more engaging experience.

Roadmap

Enhanced Visuals and Sound Effects: Add visual effects and sound effects to make the game more immersive and entertaining.

Responsive Design: Ensure that the game is responsive and works well on different screen sizes and devices.
